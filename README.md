This is an assignment to create a recipe website. It has a list of a few recipes tht are very close to my heart. 

I've performed the following tasks to create the website:
Created a new repository
Made it public
Cloned the repository using the SSH URL
Created a few folders within the repository on the local drive
Created an index file
Created a readme
Created a new page for the pasta recipe within the recipes folder
Added the boilerplate text for the index.html file and added a link to the pasta recipe
Added different headings, ordered and unordered list, and image with alt and dimensions in the Pasta.html file
git add
git status
git commit -m
